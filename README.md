# me_learning_pytorch

A repository of PyTorch models created as part of my learning process. Each folder contains a unique model demonstrating various neural network architectures.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/micfun123/learn_py_torch.git
   cd learn_py_torch
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## card recognition

1. use `card_model_trainer.py` to train the model. This will output a model file as `model.pth`
2. use `usemodel.py` to predict the card. This will output the prediction result. use `cards.csv` to look up the card name. from the index of the prediction result.
